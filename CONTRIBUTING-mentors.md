# Contributing Guide for Mentors and Sub Orgs
## Organizations Eligible Under NumFOCUS Umbrella

To be eligible to participate in GSoD under the NumFOCUS umbrella, an
organization must have:

1. One sub-org admin
   and at least two mentors (**the sub-org admin can be one of the mentors**)
   who are willing to commit for the full GSoD period.
2. NumFOCUS [Fiscally Sponsored][sponsored] or [Affiliated][affiliated] status
3. Have a good ideas page (**NumFOCUS Admins will help with that**).

The sub org administrator has the responsibility to communicate with
NumFOCUS and advertise GSoD to the community of their organization.

You can sign up as a participating org with us until the application deadline
for the current year or up to 3 days after Google announces that NumFOCUS is
participating as a umbrella org.

When you sign up with us you should also tell us your preferred way for writers
to contact you and a link to your new contributor page if you have one.

## Sub Org Administrators

Each project/organization under NumFOCUS umbrella for GSoD should have one
administrator.

The **sub-org admins** are responsible for the following:

- provide a list of projects ideas to **organization administrator**
- advertise the application to the project/organization they represent
- sign up mentors with NumFOCUS
- connect users with NumFOCUS profile
- request to **organization administrator** a minimum and a maximum number of
  slots
- assign mentors and writers to available slots
- ensure evaluations for accepted projects are submitted on time
- try to have the whole community engage with the writers in their project

## Mentors

To be a mentor please tell your sub-org administrator so they can give you all the
information you need to sign up.

## Projects

Please make sure that the project can be partly completed during the summer so
that writers pass the final evaluation. Please also read
the [writer guide][CS], especially our requirements from technical writers.

There has to be at least one primary mentor and one backup mentor per project.
This means you should have at least 2 mentors available. A mentor can only be
'primary' for one writer but a backup for as many as they like. The sub org
admin can also be a mentor.

You publish the ideas list in this repository or you can link to an ideas list
on one of your own websites/repositories.

To publish your project ideas here follow this guide.

1.  copy `YYYY/ideas/skeleton.md` to `YYYY/ideas/title-of-my-proposal.md`
    where `YYYY` is the currently year
    and `title-of-my-proposal` is a sort version of the title of your proposal.
2.  add a link to `YYYY/ideas/title-of-my-proposal.md` at `YYYY/ideas-list.md`.
3.  send a pull request with the changes at `YYYY`.
4.  [create an issue](https://github.com/numfocus/gsod/issues/new)
    where writers can ask questions.
