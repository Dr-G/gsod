# Contributing Guide for Writers

## Getting Started Early

Experience shows that the best thing to help your application is to contact the
organization you want to work with early. For this you can introduce yourself on
the mailing list of the organization. [The opensource
guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) has a good introduction how
to start contributing to open source projects.

## Am I experienced enough?

The answer is generally: **Yes**. We value creativity, intelligence and
enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use. We
think that an interested and motivated writer who is willing to learn is more
valuable than anything else. The range of available projects should suit people
with different backgrounds. At the same time if you have experience using your
project of choice or one of it's dependencies (e.g., language) make sure to let
us know about that as well.

## Our Expectations From Writers

### During the application phase

*The tips listed here can help your application. They are not required*

We favor writers that show regular communication with possible mentors /
organization until Google announces the accepted projects.

Establishing regular communication is good for 2 reasons. It shows that you are
reliable and that you have good communication skills. Good communication skills
are an important part of GSoD since a writer and mentor can rarely meet in
person.

### During the Project

*The items here are a requirement for writers during the project*

**Communication**

- Commit early and commit often! Push to a public repository (e.g., GitHub) so
  that we can see and review your work.
- Actively work on our project timeline and communicate with us during the
  community bonding period.
- Communicate often with your mentor, preferably in public using the
  standard channels of your project.
- If there is a reason why you can't work or can't contact us on a regular basis
  please make us aware of this.
- If you don't communicate with us regularly we will fail you.

**Evaluations**

- Set a realistic goal for all evaluation deadlines. If you fail to meet your
  own goal we are more likely to fail you in the evaluations.
- Create at least one public commit that has been reviewed before each
  evaluation.

## Default Instructions

**This is a general guide. Organizations can have different instructions and you
must follow their instructions**

Projects proposed by mentors are listed at our [ideas list][IL].

You are welcome to propose your own project. If you wish to do so, please
contact the organization you want to work with before you start writing your
proposal and explain your idea to them. If you choose to propose your own
project idea you will need to find a mentor for the project. **Proposals without
a mentor will not be considered.**

### How to write a great Proposal

First, think about your choice of project carefully, you're going to be doing
it for a couple of months, so it's important that you choose something you're
going to enjoy. Once you've made your mind up:

1. Make sure you've thought about the project and understand what it entails.
2. Contact us early! The earlier you contact us the earlier you will be able to
   get feedback from us to improve your application.
3. Don't be afraid to come up with original solutions to the problem.
4. Don't be afraid to give us lots of detail about how you would approach the
   project.

Overall, your application should make us believe that you are capable of
completing the project and delivering the functionality to our users. If you
aren't sure about anything, get in touch with us, we're happy to advise you.
