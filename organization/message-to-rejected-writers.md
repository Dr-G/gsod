As you can see above, your proposal to NumFOCUS umbrella was not accepted for
the Google Season of Docs this year. There were a lot of excellent applications
but resources, the number of slots Google gave us, are limited and many good
applications had to be rejected.

You helped us a lot just by submitting such a good proposal. That helped to
raise the bar. Thanks for your time and effort.

We hope that you learned something new. We'd like to have you around, and any
contribution you make to any of the projects under NumFOCUS umbrella is very
much appreciated (bug reports, participating on the list, patches, code). But of
course, we understand you may not have time.

We liked that you discussed your proposal with us. If you decide to work on your
project anyway, We are sure you'll find many people willing to help out.

We encourage you to try again next year.
Thanks and good luck!
