# NumFOCUS GSOC Operations

[NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/) will apply to Google Season of Docs (GSoD) as a
umbrella organization. [All projects/organizations supported by
NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/projects/) can participate at GSoD under NumFOCUS
umbrella. Projects/organizations not supported by NumFOCUS can participate at
GSoD under NumFOCUS umbrella if approved by NumFOCUS board.

## NumFOCUS Administrator for GSoD

The NumFOCUS board will indicate two persons, named in this document as
**organization administrator**, to be in charge of NumFOCUS application **for
each edition** of GSoD.

The **organization administrators** are responsible for

- create the initial application for NumFOCUS to apply for GSoD
- advertise the application to **all** projects/organization supported by
  NumFOCUS
- manage NumFOCUS profile at GSoD
- request a minimum and a maximum number of slots that can accomodate the slots
  requested by each project/organization under NumFOCUS umbrella.
- stay in contact with sub-org admins

### How to sign up mentors

You can use google forms to sign up mentors who want to work with NumFOCUS. This
will have the advantage that we automatically have a list of all mentors and
their contact information. Mentors should be given access to numfocus mentoring
mailing list.

## Guidelines to Select Accept Writers Proposals

**Note**: Slots are requested after the writers submission phase ends

**Sub Orgs** will discuss and accept/reject writers proposal based on:

1.  the number of slots received;
2.  if the proposal already has at least one mentor;
3.  writer background and proposal.

**If** NumFOCUS received less slots than then requested the **organization
administrators** solve conflicts in slots allocation for each sub org. We will
try to assign at least one slot to each sub org.
